# About Berkay Tumal
I develop open source projects and host them on GitHub!

---
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m a **computer engineering** student based in Istanbul with a passion for **web development** and **repurposing old tech**.

I love modernizing outdated devices by tweaking their software, or taking old ideas and design trends and renovating them to show them off on modern hardware.

If youâ€™ve enjoyed any of my work or just want to support a student developer, feel free to buy me a coffee ^^ â˜• Every bit of support helps me keep learning, experimenting, and bringing cool ideas to life.

Thanks for stopping by! <3
